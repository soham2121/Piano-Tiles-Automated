I ran the game on 1920 X 1080 relosution. Some setup is required if not on the same resolution and/or if the game is not fullscreen.
I used https://pixspy.com/ for image cordinates and https://www.crazygames.com/game/perfect-piano for the game.
After running the program and switching tabs to the game press Q to initiate it.
Hold T to terminate the program.
